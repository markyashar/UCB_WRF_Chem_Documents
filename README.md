Postdoctoral Scholar-Employee, University of California, Berkeley (UCB), Department of Earth and Planetary Science, 
Berkeley, California (CA)
Supervisor: Dr. Inez Fung, Professor of Atmospheric Science; Contributor to the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to 
the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC)
•	Carried out research focused on mesoscale and regional (forward or“bottom-up”) atmospheric transport modeling and 
analysis of anthropogenic and biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from northern California for multi-scale estimation and 
quantification of atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
•	Made extensive use of WRF (written mostly in FORTRAN), the WRF-Chem coupled weather-air quality model for atmospheric 
transport simulations, and the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (WRF-VPRM) biospheric model to simulate 
CO2 biosphere fluxes and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This work also involved the use of the R statistical scripting 
language, the NCAR Command Language (NCL), MATLAB, Python, and Ferret for additional pre- and post-processing, 
modification, and visualization of netCDF files, and further enabling and expediting data analysis of simulation results.
•	Troubleshooted WRF, WRF-Chem, and VPRM simulation runs and results to increase data efficiency and to decrease time to
solve problems.
•	Installed, compiled, built, and configured WRF, WRF-Chem, and VPRM on the National Energy Research Scientific Computing
Center (NERSC) multi-core supercomputing system “Hopper” and submitted batch job scripts to this system to run the WRF 
model simulations.
•	Assisted students and post-docs in installing and configuring WRF and WRF-Chem.
